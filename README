Setting Up Gulp
========================================================
You must have npm(Node Package Manager) installed first,
which is part of Node.js.

Check out https://nodejs.org/ to install Nodejs.

You should have a package.json file in your directory
when you retrieve this repository.

Entering:
npm install

will automatically install all the dependencies you need.
If that DOESN'T WORK: try the steps below.

Once that is done, install gulp globally using npm by:
npm install -g gulp 

After it is globally installed, then install locally 
to your project with:
npm install --save-dev gulp

then install each plugin needed using:
npm install --save-dev plugin-name

The list of packages should be listed in packages.json


Running Gulp
========================================================
After you installed gulp, there should be a gulpfile.js
file that has the configurations on what gulp will do.

You should've downloaded an already created gulpfile.js.
So all you need to do to get started is type in:
gulp

Here are separate command to certain tasks without running
everything.

Enter gulp minify to just minify the css files
Enter gulp uglify to just minify the js files
